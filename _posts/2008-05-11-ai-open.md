SF.net is famous for its various kinds of open source projects. Now we have UFO:AI, an open source game~~
 
The story happens in 2084. Background: China and the United States began a second Cold War from 2010 to 2040. In the end, China was democratized and became the core of the Asia Republic. United States suffered from its huge military deficit, and was later reformed by some progressive president. Then Mexico, Canada and the United States merged into a United America. The world enjoyed a short peaceful time, when United America, the Revolutionary Countries, the Greater European Union, New Africa, the Middle-Eastern Alliance, Russia, the Asian Republic and the Commonwealth of Oceania dominated the reformed UN. After that alien UFO attacked the earch intermitantly, then UN decided to fight against the aliens. Here goes our story~

My NVidia LE7300 is slow when the focus is near the aircraft, maybe it's a programming bug :D The FPS is typically 60 when the focus is off the aircraft.
