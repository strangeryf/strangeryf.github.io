I don't know when it started this service, but you can search code with Google now -> http://www.google.com/codesearch. The search can even support regular expressions.

I tried 'stockwell transform lang:c++', and I was led to a French site http://virgo.web.lal.in2p3.fr. It is for almost 2 years that I have not dipped into Mr. R. G. Stockwell's stuffs, got a little rusty on it :D
