Geocaching requires GPS, but my integrated GPS still did not work yesterday. But D. and B. L. brought their GPS devices, and we finally found almost all the treasures in Castle Rock State Park.

When R. found the last one, however, D.â€™s GPS told him that the target is still 10 feet away. What a accurate GPS. BTW, 3 spots have been found by others in the same day.
