Last week, I downloaded and burned the 5 CDs of FC4 from fedora.redhat.com. After installation, I found that the look and feel didnâ€™t change much as to FC3. But KDE 3.4 has a few good improvements: 1. che recycle bin can really recycle deleted files, 2. wall paper can "slide show", 3. I can right click to edit a menu item as in windows. And maybe because the new system is based on GCC4, the booting speed is faster than FC3, and so is the shutting down speed. After installing the up-to-date driver, my Nvidia card can smoothly run 3D games such as ppracer, chromium, canon smash, Nexuiz... etc, while ATI cards, as usual, seem need no driver to have good performance in those games.
