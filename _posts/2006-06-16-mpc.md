MPC(Media Player Classic) is a very good open source player for windows. More and more new players were "created" based on it, and they began to bind unwanted adware in their packages.

GOM Player is an unacquainted free all media player made by the Koreans, and it is available at http://gom.ipop.co.kr/release/down.html?intSeq=157. There are also Japanese and Chinese versions available.

MPlayer is the most famous player in Linux, it supports nearly all formats you can find if you have the correct codecs installed. In the year 2005, some developers released a Windows frontend for MPlayer â€“ MPUI, which is available at sf.net. The frontend facilitates the playing so we do not need to use the command line. All you need to do is download the MPUI with MPlayer. Remember to download the Windows codecs from http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/design7/codecs.html. A bad news is, MPlayer had removed the windows-all-xxxxxx.zip package from its website because of patent issue. For some clips, MPUI works better than MPC and GOM Player.

Just have fun!
