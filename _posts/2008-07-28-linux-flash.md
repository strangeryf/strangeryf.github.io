The Adobe guys are too lazy to release a AMD64 version of flash plugin for linux. Thanks to the Ubuntu MOTU developers, we have flashplugin-nonfree: Adobe Flash Player plugin installer.

This package will download the Flash Player from Adobe. It is a Netscape/Mozilla type plugin. Any browser based on Netscape or Mozilla can use the Flash plugin. This package currently supports the following browsers: Mozilla, Mozilla-Firefox, Firefox, Iceweasel, and Iceape. Also Galeon and Epiphany can use the Flash plugin. Konqueror can also use the Flash plugin if konqueror-nsplugins is installed.

WARNING: Installing this Ubuntu package causes the Adobe flash plugin to be downloaded from http://www.adobe.com. The distribution license of the Adobe flash plugin is available at http://www.adobe.com. Installing this Ubuntu package implies that you have accepted the terms of that license.
