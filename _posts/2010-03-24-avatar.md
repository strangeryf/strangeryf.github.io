Did not know avatar is from India before searching wikipedia:

*In Hinduism, Avatar or Avatāra (Devanagari अवतार, Sanskrit for "descent" [viz., from heaven to earth]) refers to a deliberate descent of a deity from heaven to earth, and is mostly translated into English as "incarnation", but more accurately as "appearance" or "manifestation".*

In Summer Wars(サマーウォーズ, 2009), the Japs used the same word Avatar in a network game as the embodiment of a player.
