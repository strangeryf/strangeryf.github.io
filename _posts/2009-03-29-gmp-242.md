GNU MP was said to be the fastest library for big number, high precision arithmetic. It is portable, and efficient, which means it has been optimized for lots of processors. It is achieved by choosing algorithms based on the sizes of the operands, and the keeping the overhead at minimum. Similar to FFTW, isn’t it?

There’s no Windows 4.2.4 binary available from the official site. It has to be worked out by myself. I tried serveral times before I found the following steps to build it. Remember, the building process takes a long time.

1. Download tdm-mingw-1.902.0-f1.exe, msysCORE-1.0.11-20080826.tar.gz and flex-2.5.4a-1-bin.zip from sf.net. The tdm package contains the latest gcc binaries for Windows. The msysCORE package contains the basic utilities, esp. sh.exe, which is used to generate the Makefile.
2. Unpack gmp-4.2.4.tar.bz2 to folder gmp-4.2.4
3. Enter mingw using the "MinGW Command Prompt", cd to gmp-4.2.4
4. run "sh configure"
5. run "make" (slow)
6. run "make check", make sure all test executable is "PASS" (warned you, quite slow!)
 
My configuration is, Win XP SP3 (x86-based), PD 820, 2 Gigabyte RAM.
