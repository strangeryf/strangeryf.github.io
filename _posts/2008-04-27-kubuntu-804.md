The Kubuntu team just released 8.04 on April 24, and there is a "Remix" version with KDE 4. I tried KDE on windows, and it was ... very buggy. Each KDE windows application needs some sockets connection to kdeinit something, which will cause the firewall to complain every time. I found my hda, hdb something became SCSI1, SCSI4, really odd.
 
KDE 4 is now using Qt4, so its applications become a little faster. The filemanager is renamed to Dolphin, and Konqueror is still the default web browser. Some buddies said that there were some translation errors, and strange characters in the menu. Who knows, I will try it later.
