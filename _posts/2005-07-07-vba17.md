Recently upgrade to FC4, and I must rebuild my gtk version of VisualBoyAdvance 1.7.2, that is gvba. See walkthrough below :-)

1. Decompress and install libsigc++-2.0.10.tar.bz2
1. Run shell command
    ```shell
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/share/pkgconfig
    ```
1. Decompress and install glibmm-2.4.7.tar.bz2
1. Decompress and install gtkmm-2.4.11.tar.bz2(be patient, very time-consuming...)
1. Decompress and install libglademm-2.3.4.tar.bz2
1. Coment out line 248 of /usr/local/include/libglademm-2.4/libglademm/xml.h
1. Decompress VisualBoyAdvance-src-1.7.2.tar.gz, and run shell command
    ```shell
    ./configure --enable-gtk=2.4
    ```
    then
    ```shell
    make;make install
    ```
    It took a long time to complie GBA.cpp :-( 
1. Add "/usr/local/lib" to /etc/ld.so.conf as a new line, then "ldconfig"

Remember not to run gvba and VisualBoyAdvance in KDE, the sound is ... too bad.
BTW, the Mah-Jong game from http://www.stevens-bradfield.com/MahJong/ needs the currenct directory "." in your PATH variable!
Enjoy the games :D
