Almost three years ago, Code::Blocks released its first version. It was a very nice free open-source IDE for Windows OS at that time. Fancy GUI library was used, latest GCC was supported, and visual debugging was made possible.

After I opened www.codeblocks.org this morning, I found that a new release has been declared and the "nightly build" has been removed.

    A new release is coming!

    Catchy title, isn’t it? And the best part is that it’s true!

    Our long awaited release is coming very soon. It’s only a matter of few days. We only want to iron out a few issues with the installers and perform some administrative tasks before the release.

    Stay tuned!

Just can not wait :D  Come on, Code::Blocks 8.02
