Fed is more and more aggresive against the subprime mortgage crisis: cut the rates repeatedly and left inflation aside. As a result, J.P. Morgan Chase is allowed to purchase Bear Stearns at an unexpected low price – $2 a share. Till March 16, 2008, financial insitutions had recognized  losses or write-downs exceeding U.S. $175 billion.
 
Goldman Sachs is always a peculiar one – although it had a $1.4 billion write-down in Q1 2008, its net income reached $1.51 billion. Even it was almost a half of last year, the result exceeded the market’s expectations. No one knows when it will suffer a great loss.
