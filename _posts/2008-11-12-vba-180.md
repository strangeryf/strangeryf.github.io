I made a successful build of VBA 1.8.0 (Ubuntu patch: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/v/visualboyadvance/visualboyadvance_1.8.0-4ubuntu1.diff.gz), last night. And the patch is simple for x86-64 arch:
```
diff prof.cpp ~/src/VisualBoyAdvance-1.8.0/src/prof/prof.cpp
270a271
>       long temp = (long)seg->tos[toindex].selfpc;
274c275
<          profWrite32(fd, (u32)seg->tos[toindex].selfpc) ||
—
>          profWrite32(fd, (u32)temp) ||
```
In which, var seg is a profile_segment structure
```c
typedef struct profile_segment {
  unsigned short *froms;
  struct tostruct *tos;
  long  tolimit;

  u32  s_lowpc;
  u32  s_highpc;
  unsigned long s_textsize;
 
  int ssiz;
  char *sbuf;
  int s_scale;
 
  struct profile_segment *next;

} profile_segment;
```

And tostruct is defined as
```c
struct tostruct
  {
    char *selfpc;
    int count;
    unsigned short link;
  };
```

So, it is converting from "char *" to "u32" (typedef unsigned int u32;). In x86-64, "char *", which is a pointer, becomes 8 bytes instead of 4 bytes. As a result, g++ will prevent it from converting to "unsigned int", which is still 4 bytes, because of precision lost.

Another exciting result came from BearOso’s snes9x-gtk. Aside from the dependencies listed in the thread, "intltool" and "libxv-dev" need to be installed before the building. And in the final linking, I have to copy the "g++ blablabla" line and append -lXv manually to get the snes9x-gtk binary.
