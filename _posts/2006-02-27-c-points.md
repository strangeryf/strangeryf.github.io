1. inline functions
1) gcc will not inline a function by default even with keyword "static", you should use -O which does not conflict with -g;
2) inline function should be defined in the header file not just declare

2. Default font & color schema for Kate will not work, because they just bold the font, however lots of font have no bold style! i have to modify the default color schema.

3. ElectricFence doesnâ€™t help you find memory leaks, just memory corruption:
    ```c
    // memleak.c
    #include <malloc.h>

    int main()
    {
        char * str = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char)*4);
        free(str);
        str[0] = 'c';
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    ```shell
    $./memleak

4. gcc3.4.4 do not support using printf to print type long long(%llu, %lld)

5. preprocessor output option for vc is /P(/C comment), for gcc is -E -o
