I bought a Nokia 5800xm 3 weeks ago. There are lots of Java games availabe, but it is very annoying that the gravity sensor will change the display orientation, and the built-in Java VM provides each game with an on-screen keyboard. To disable the orientation, I have to disable the sensor from Settings->Phone->Sensor settings->Sensors->Off. To disable the keyboard for some full screen games, I have to click Settings->Application mgr.->Installled apps.->select the installed game->Options->Suite settings->On-screen keyboard->off.

After installing some games, I found they have no auto-change of orientation, and no on-screen keyboard. With the help of 7-zip, I found some clues from their manifest file: they usually have these lines:

    Nokia-MIDlet-Category: Game
    Nokia-MIDlet-App-Orientation: landscape
    Nokia-MIDlet-On-Screen-Keypad: no
    Nokia-MIDlet-No-Exit: true

Itâ€™s obvious that the orientation line specifies the desired orientation, and the on-screen keypad line disables the on-screen keyboard.
 
I added some lines to the MANIFEST.MF file in *.jar\META-INF, updated the jar file with 7-zip, and install the jar again. The issues went away
