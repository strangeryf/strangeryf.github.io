I bought a DC today, itâ€™s not expensive, so the picture quality is not high. After getting it, I went to my windsill and took some shots against the newly born buds using the micro-focus feature. Well, the picutre in the LCD looked perfect: with good color saturation, and clear border. However, after I uploaded it to my PC, I found there are lots of noise points outside of the focus.

In the night, I took some other shots, and the quality deteriorated considerably. Maybe I have to adjust the exposure and aperture settings maunally. As a newbie, I have a lot to learn ~~~
