According to New York Times(http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html?hp), Merrill Lynch will be sold to Bank of America for roughly $50 billion to avert a deepening financial crisis on frantic September 14th, however, Lehman Brothers will file for bankruptcy. The corresponding Yahoo Finance’s title is "Wall Street awakes to 2 storied firms gone"(http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080915/financial_meltdown.html).

Crisis is not only over investement banks. The world’s largest insurance company, American International Group Inc., whose stock has fallen 79% over the past year, has to seek $40 billion before September 15’s morning to avert a credit rating downgrade.

Since this crisis is affecting a broader economy, the commercial banks will suffer from potential loesses on credit cards, auto loans and student loans in years.

I worried about this for some hours, then I decided to make an augury. Believe it or not, the result is ...... auspicious!
