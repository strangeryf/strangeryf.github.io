When dealing with binary files, some macros are often used and misused. In fact, standards has ruled how they shall be used:

6.5.3.4 The sizeof operator
Constraints
1 The sizeof operator shall not be applied to an expression that has function type or an incomplete type, to the parenthesized name of such a type, or to an expression that designates a bit-field member.
Semantics
2 The sizeof operator yields the size (in bytes) of its operand, which may be an expression or the parenthesized name of a type. The size is determined from the type of the operand. The result is an integer. If the type of the operand is a variable length array type, the operand is evaluated; otherwise, the operand is not evaluated and the result is an integer constant.
3 When applied to an operand that has type char, unsigned char, or signed char, (or a qualified version thereof) the result is 1. When applied to an operand that has array type, the result is the total number of bytes in the array.(*) When applied to an operand that has structure or union type, the result is the total number of bytes in such an object, including internal and trailing padding.
4 The value of the result is implementation-defined, and its type (an unsigned integer type) is size_t, defined in <stddef.h> (and other headers).
5 EXAMPLE 1 A principal use of the sizeof operator is in communication with routines such as storage allocators and I/O systems. A storage-allocation function might accept a size (in bytes) of an object to allocate and return a pointer to void. For example:
    extern void *alloc(size_t);
    double *dp = alloc(sizeof *dp);
The implementation of the alloc function should ensure that its return value is aligned suitably for conversion to a pointer to double.
6 EXAMPLE 2 Another use of the sizeof operator is to compute the number of elements in an array:
sizeof array / sizeof array[0]
7 EXAMPLE 3 In this example, the size of a variable-length array is computed and returned from a function:
    #include <stddef.h>
    size_t fsize3(int n)
    {
        char b[n+3]; // variable length array
        return sizeof b; // execution time sizeof
    }
    int main()
    {
        size_t size;
        size = fsize3(10); // fsize3 returns 13
        return 0;
    }
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(*) When applied to a parameter declared to have array or function type, the sizeof operator yields the size of the adjusted (pointer) type (see 6.9.1).

6.7.2.1 Structure and union specifiers
17 EXAMPLE Assuming that all array members are aligned the same, after the declarations:
    struct s { int n; double d[]; };
    struct ss { int n; double d[1]; };
    the three expressions:
    sizeof (struct s)
    offsetof(struct s, d)
    offsetof(struct ss, d)
have the same value. The structure struct s has a flexible array member d.
```

5.3.3 Sizeof [expr.sizeof]
1 The sizeof operator yields the number of bytes in the object representation of its operand. The operand is either an expression, which is not evaluated, or a parenthesized type-id. The sizeof operator shall not be applied to an expression that has function or incomplete type, or to an enumeration type before all its enumerators have been declared, or to the parenthesized name of such types, or to an lvalue that designates a bit-field. sizeof(char), sizeof(signed char) and sizeof(unsigned char) are 1; the result of sizeof applied to any other fundamental type (3.9.1) is implementation-defined. [Note: in particular, sizeof(bool) and sizeof(wchar_t) are implementation-defined.(69) ] [Note: See 1.7 for the definition of byte and 3.9 for the definition of object representation. ]
2 When applied to a reference or a reference type, the result is the size of the referenced type. When applied to a class, the result is the number of bytes in an object of that class including any padding required for placing objects of that type in an array. The size of a most derived class shall be greater than zero (1.8). The result of applying sizeof to a base class subobject is the size of the base class type.(70) When applied to an array, the result is the total number of bytes in the array. This implies that the size of an array of n elements is n times the size of an element.
3 The sizeof operator can be applied to a pointer to a function, but shall not be applied directly to a function.
4 The lvalue-to-rvalue (4.1), array-to-pointer (4.2), and function-to-pointer (4.3) standard conversions are not applied to the operand of sizeof.
5 Types shall not be defined in a sizeof expression.
6 The result is a constant of type size_t. [Note: size_t is defined in the standard header
<cstddef>(18.1). ]
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
(69) sizeof(bool) is not required to be 1.
(70) The actual size of a base class subobject may be less than the result of applying sizeof to the subobject, due to virtual base classes and less strict padding requirements on base class subobjects.

18.1 Types
5 The macro offsetof accepts a restricted set of type arguments in this International Standard. type shall be a POD structure or a POD union (clause 9). The result of applying the offsetof macro to a field that is a static data member or a function member is undefined.
be changed by specify a "#pragma pack(n)" directive. GCC follows the same rules for compatibility with Win32.
```
Most implementations have their own strategies of internal and tailing padding for memory alignment. For example, MSVC (32-bit) requires 8-byte packing by default, and the size of a struct type shall be a multiple of 8. This can  be changed by specify a "#pragma pack(n)" directive. GCC follows the same rules for compatibility with Win32.
