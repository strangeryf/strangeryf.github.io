It’s dull and depressing…Everybody install, configurate, and deploy and do nothing at all. Then uninstall, and… At least there’s some interesting TV programs can be received in the pub… And I had to strive for the limited number of Internet-accessible PCs… So I leave so many useless words here just to prove that…………… I AM STILL ALIVE
