title:  "Compile Wesnoth 1.6a with MinGW (gcc4.3.3-dw2-tdm-1)"
date:   2009-04-11

I tried to compile Wesnoth 1.6a with the tdm GCC bundle. The default one supports SJLJ, but it is expected to use dwarf-2 unwinding. nuwen.net has a good MinGW bundle, which contains lots of libraries including boost, SDL, ogg and png. It saves a lot of time to build the wesnoth binary.
 
Dwarf-2 vs. SJLJ unwinding
GCC supports two methods of stack frame unwinding: Dwarf-2 (DW2) or SJLJ (setjmp/longjmp). DW2 unwinding is desirable for a number of reasons, but cannot yet (on Windows) pass exceptions through "foreign" stack frames (code compiled by another non-DW2-enabled compiler, such as OS DLLs in a Windows callback). This means that you should choose the SJLJ version of TDM-GCC unless you can be certain you will never throw an exception through a foreign stack area. See README-gcc-tdm.txt, included in the core package, for further usage notes on this topic. TDM releases from the GCC 4.2 series use the SJLJ unwind method.

The steps are

1. Get mingw-4.1.tar.bz2 from http://nuwen.net/mingw.html, unpack to C:\.

2. Get msysCORE-1.0.11-20080826.tar.gz from sf.net, unpack to C:\MinGW. Copy mingwvars.bat from tdm-gcc build.

3. Change prefix in sdl-config to /usr.
Comment out C:\MinGW\include\SDL\SDL_stdinc.h line 581.

4. Get SDL_ttf-devel-2.0.9-VC8.zip from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf.
Copy SDL_ttf.h from \include to C:\MinGW\include\SDL.
Go to \lib, rename SDL_ttf.lib to libSDL_ttf.a, copy the file to C:\MinGW\lib.
Get SDL_ttf-2.0.9-win32.zip from the same URL.
Unpack SDL_ttf.dll to C:\MinGW\bin.

5. Get SDL_image-devel-1.2.7-VC9.zip from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image.
Copy SDL_image.h from \include to C:\MinGW\include\SDL.
Go to \lib, rename SDL_image.lib to libSDL_image.a, copy the file to C:\MinGW\lib.
Get SDL_image-1.2.7-win32.zip from the same URL. Unpack to C:\MinGW\bin.

6. Get SDL_net-devel-1.2.7-VC8.zip from http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net.
Copy SDL_net.h from \include to C:\MinGW\include\SDL.
Go to \lib, rename SDL_net.lib to libSDL_net.a, copy the file to C:\MinGW\lib.
Get SDL_net-1.2.7-win32.zip from the same URL.
Unpack SDL_net.dll to C:\MinGW\bin.

7. Get libpng-1.2.35-lib.zip and libpng-1.2.35-bin.zip from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfile … p_id=23617, unpack to C:\MinGW.
Change prefix in C:\MinGW\bin\libpng12-config, C:\MinGW\bin\libpng-config, C:\MinGW\lib\pkgconfig\libpng12.pc and C:\MinGW\lib\pkgconfig\libpng.pc to /usr.
Copy libpng12.dll as libpng12-0.dll.

8. Get libintl-0.14.4-lib.zip, jpeg-6b-4-bin.zip, zlib-1.2.3-bin.zip and tiff-3.8.2-1-bin.zip from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfile … p_id=23617.
Unpack each to C:\MinGW.
Rename libtiff3.dll to tiff.dll in \bin.

9. In C:\MinGW\include\c++\4.3.3-dw2-tdm-1\cwchar, comment out line 164 and 171 (for swprintf and vswprintf)

10. Get pkg-config-0.23-2.zip, glib_2.20.0-1_win32.zip and gettext-runtime-0.17-1.zip from http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html, unpack to C:\MinGW.
Copy intl.dll as libintl3.dll.
Open "msys.bat" or "mingwvars.bat" in a text editor. Add the following lines for pkg-config support.
    ```shell
    @set PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig
    ```
11. Get libunicows-1.1.1-mingw32.zip from http://libunicows.sourceforge.net.
Unpack *.a to C:\MinGW\lib.

12. Get pango-dev_1.24.0-1_win32.zip, pango_1.24.0-1_win32.zip, glib-dev_2.20.0-1_win32.zip, cairo-dev_1.8.6-1_win32.zip, cairo_1.8.6-1_win32.zip and fontconfig-dev-2.4.2-tml-20071015.zip from http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html.
Unpack each to C:\MinGW.

13. MinGW\include\boost\iostreams\detail\streambuf\indirect_streambuf.hpp: change line 285~286 to
    ```cpp
    if ( (output_buffered() && pptr() == 0) ||
         (shared_buffer() && gptr() != 0) )
    ```

14. MinGW\include\boost\iostreams\filter\symmetric.hpp: change line 126 to
    ```cpp
            if ( (status == f_would_block && buf.ptr() == buf.eptr()) ||
    ```
15. Get wesnoth-1.6a.tar.bz2 from http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#St … _branch.29. Unpack to somewhere.
In wesnoth-1.6a\src\network_worker.cpp: change line 307 to
    ```cpp
            } while(retval == 0 || (retval == -1 && errno == EINTR));
    ```
16. Start mingwvars.bat, go to wesnoth source folder, run "sh configure".
Edit the genarted Makefile in wesnoth-1.6a\src, append " -lws2_32" to the LIBS line:
```makefile
LIBS = -lm  -L/usr/lib -lz -lws2_32
```
Run "make", then "make install".

17. Go to C:\MinGW\local\bin folder, run "wesnoth". Enjoy!

I am not sure if I am correct in modifying the source code. But the game just run fine :D
