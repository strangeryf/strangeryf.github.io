KDE4 is different from KDE3 in many different ways. To enable root login in Kubuntu, the steps are

1. Set the root password
    ```shell
    sudo passwd root
    ```
2. Open the kdmrc
    ```shell
    sudo vi /etc/kde4/kdm/kdmrc
    ```
3. Set AllowRootLogin as "true"
4. Save, logout current session, and login as root
