Four months later, GCC 4.2.3 was released after 4.2.2.
http://gcc.gnu.org/
 
TDM got a very quick response this time: just 1 day after GCC’s release, TDM’s experimental build is available.

I noticed that lots of packages in TDM’s "installation" section have been updated. I wonder if TDM could made an all-in-one package for the user. The downloading, decompressing process is somewhat dull and long. Anyway, I got this in my console:

    gcc (GCC) 4.2.3 (TDM-1 for MinGW)
    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
    warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

However, the -d options are not implemented in MinGW yet. In the manual(http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.2.3/gcc/Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options), it reads

    Most debug dumps can be enabled either passing a letter to the -d option, or with a long -fdump-rtl switch; here are the possible letters for use in letters and pass, and their meanings:
    .........
    -dm
        Print statistics on memory usage, at the end of the run, to standard error. 

    .........

But in TDM’s build(and even other build in Linux), this option is always a dummy: nothing will print to STDERR.
