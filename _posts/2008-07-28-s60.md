Basicly, I can not find anything useful about this "Ecmt gateway is not running" from Google. After I happened to check my configuration according to the C:/S60/devices/S60_3rd_MIDP_SDK_FP1/docs/SDK_Help/GUID-1BFA34D6-7D95-4F8E-9F7D-13A3306025DB.html, I found that this means I have set my "Device" as "S60Device" instead of "S60Emulator".
 
For encoding problem, I put the following to my code
```cpp
// Put the read string into the buffer,
// but leave the ending CR LF pair out
if (!closed) {
    sb.setLength(sb.length() - 2);
    byte[] tmp = new byte[sb.length()];
    for (int i=0; i<sb.length(); i++)
        tmp[i] = (byte)sb.charAt(i);
    String enc = new String(tmp, "GB2312");
    //readBuffer.put(sb.toString());
    readBuffer.put(enc);
}
```
and I can read some Chinese chars from NNTP in my phone :D
