A Letter from an Unknown Woman (1922)

by Stephan Zweig

German biographer, essayist, short story writer, and cosmopolitan, Stephan Zweig (1881-1943) was a prolific writer whose vivid portrayals of his characters, whether fictional or factual, were emphatically probing and believable. In the 1930s Zweig was one of the most widely translated authors of the world. His extensive travels led him to India, Africa, North and Central America, and Russia.

Born in Vienna into a family of wealthy industrialist, Zweig studied in Austria, France, and Germany. By 1904 he had earned a doctorate from Vienna University, and he traveled widely before settling in Salzburg in 1913. In 1914, he married Friderike von Winternitz, who had started to send him fan mail in 1901, when his first work, a collection of poems, appeared. Zweig later became known as a biographer, short-story writer, and novelist. Zwieg’s biographical essays include portraits of Honoré de Balzac, Charles Dickens, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky; he was interested in the teachings of Sigmund Freud, which influenced his
biographies as well as his fiction. Several of Zweig’s stories have been filmed, the best-known of which is Letter From an Unknown Woman, directed by Max Ophüls (1948).
