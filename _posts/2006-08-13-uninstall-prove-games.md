Most games are uninstallation-prove, that is to say, you donâ€™t have to install them again after you reinstall the OS. There are exceptions, yes, most rules have. After reinstalling the OS, some games refused to show up, and said that "Can find the specified xxx". What the hell dose it mean?
 
Literally, something is missing. A guru may use a file monitor to find out something, but he will not. The fact is, the corresponding registery keys and entries were not created after the reinstallation. Ok, you need a registry monitor, then create the missing keys and entries (shown with a "not found" result in the monitor).
 
This method might help. Have fun, players!
