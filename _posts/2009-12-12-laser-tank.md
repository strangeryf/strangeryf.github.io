I played this game more than 5 years ago. I found it occasionally when I was surfing the internet. After I reinstalled the OS, I could not find it any more. I remember it was a free game with tanks, laser and mirrors. It was not an addictive game but it was interesting. A couple of days ago, with some kind of luck, I tried the keywords: "tank puzzle game" in Google, and found it in this link http://www.freedownloadscenter.com/Reviews/r354.html :D 

But that’s a dead link, I had to search "laser tank" and found the original link: http://pages.globetrotter.net/lasertank/ltank_en.html. To my surprise, the source code is also provided. It is written in C, using the Windows API and starting with WinMain. The compiler is lcc, and I am not sure whether it is the same one that Matlab used.

I am still in level "313 – Kids" now.
