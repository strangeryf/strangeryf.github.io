I can’t drive, so I walk to work. To cross the road, I have to press the button under a traffice pole. And then the pole on the opposite side will show a white walking man, and I can get through after the 25 seconds’ count down.

Love this lawn, but failed to take a picture of the squirrel on the pine. It kept jumping from one branch to another, and then disappeared.

I live near this apartment. The weather went extreme these days: it was hot yesterday, but it became cold and windy today. Mr. R. D. told me that there is a joke: never trust the weather or women in CA. Maybe the poor guy himself invented this joke.
