*"I suppose, Watson, We must look upon you as a man of letters," said he. "How do you define the word ‘grotesque’?"
"Strange- remarkable," I suggested.
He shook his head at my definition.
"There is surely something more than that," said he; "some underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible. If you cast your mind back to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a long-suffering public, you will recognize how often the grotesque has deepened into the criminal.
             – Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge, His Last Bow*

When I arrived in SF 10 days ago, I tried to find my exact loction using my integrated GPS on my Nokia. But there was no signal all the way from SF to Cup. In the following several days before Halloween, Nokia Map kept refusing to position correctly because of no satellite signal. But when I went to Sar on Halloween for a festival, I found my position was correctly shown on Nokia Map. Then I returned to Cup in the evening, when I was in the Valley Church, the GPS worked fine. I took some pictures in the church which embedded GPS information in the JPG file:
![img]({{ '/assets/images/20091031077.jpg' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }
![img]({{ '/assets/images/20091031073.jpg' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }
It even worked perfectly when I returned to the apartment, and then I marked the exact location with a star:
![img]({{ '/assets/images/Cupertino.jpg' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }
But right after the Halloween, Nokia Map lost satellite signal again! It is so grotesque that it did not work in the following 3 days. It seems that Halloween does have some kind of magic that makes things happen :o BTW, there were 3 children who knocked my door on that night playing the time-honored treat-or-trick game, and they got some unusual presents :D
