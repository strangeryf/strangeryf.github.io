1. GNU make will complain that "Makefile:x: *** missing seperator. Stop." It really means that every such line begins with a TAB.
1. Even if declared with "volatile", gcc -O will take the liberty to optimize a variable like this:
    ```c
    #define do_something(a)      \
    ...............\
    ...............
    volatile int a, b;
    int res;
    do_something(a);
    ...............
    do_something(b);
    res = b - a;
    ```
You will get a zero if using -O. However, msc, that is Visual C++, will not do this, even with the option /Ox.
