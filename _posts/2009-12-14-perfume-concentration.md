I went to the Macy’s nearby this afternoon for some lotion anf fragrance. One sales associate helped me to find the exact model my friend requried, and she found the same model but there’s subtle difference with between types. She ask me "you dee perfume" or "you dee toilet"? I was consfused. Then she explained the smell of the former is more intense than the latter.
 
I found the "Eau de Parfum" on the bottle, and searched it on the web. Two definitions were found from wikipedia and Ask Yahoo:

    Perfume types reflect the concentration of aromatic compounds in a solvent, which in fine fragrance is typically ethanol or a mix of water and ethanol. Various sources differ considerably in the definitions of perfume types. The concentration by percent/volume of perfume oil is as follows:

        Perfume extract (Extrait): 15-40% (IFRA: typical 20%) aromatic compounds
        Eau de Parfum (EdP), Parfum de Toilette (PdT): 10-20% (typical ~15%) aromatic compounds. Sometimes listed as "eau de perfume" or "millésime".
        Eau de Toilette (EdT): 5-15% (typical ~10%) aromatic compounds
        Eau de Cologne (EdC): Chypre citrus type perfumes with 3-8% (typical ~5%) aromatic compounds
        Splash and After shave: 1-3% aromatic compounds

    From highest concentration to least, the different forms of perfume are:

        Perfume, also called extract or extrait perfume, can include 15-40% perfume concentrates.This is the purest form of scented product and is the most expensive as a result.

        Eau de parfum contains about 7-15% perfume concentrates. This is the most popular and common form of perfume. It provides a long-lasting fragrance and generally doesn’t cost as much as extract perfume.

        Eau de toilette has around 1-6% perfume concentrates. This makes for a light scent that doesn’t linger as long as the more intense versions. It was originally intended to be a refreshing body splash to help people wake up in the morning.

        Eau de cologne is sometimes used interchangeably with the term eau de toilette. However, the concoction began as the name of a light, fresh fragrance mixed with citrus oils and was made popular by Napoleon. Some perfumers today have a version of this called eau fraiche.
