My firends all know that I did not like RTS and other strategy games. But things are changing. I come across ‘The Battle for Wesnoth’ some months ago, and recently has got addictive to it :D
 
I think most ppl have an impression that there are few games with complicated story lines in Linux. I love to play ‘Frozen Bubble’, ‘PP Racer’ and a frog game each time I finished an installation of a different distro. Three or four months ago, I happened to install ‘wesnoth’ from the software installer shipped by ‘Kubuntu 8.04’. I found that its interface is as complicated as a commercial game, and it even has its own tutorial.
 
The game has MP as well as SP mode, as many other strategy game has. For the SP mode, there are official scenarios – which are called ‘campaigns’ – and custom scenarios – which can be downloaded from the official site by clicking the ‘Adds-on’ button. According to the official campaign ‘The Rise of Wesnoth’, Wesnoth is the short for ‘Wes’ and ‘Noth’, which means ‘West’ and ‘North’ in the language of King Haldric’s homeland. They are in fact intruders (refugees) to the Wesnoth land, however they gave power balance to the race of elves and drawfs. And helped them to fight against the undead, the monsters and the orcs.
 
Some of the campaigns are too hard for the ‘normal’ difficulty, and here we have the ‘Debug Mode’ for cheating. You can ‘create a unit’, give gold, set HP/MP, and even turn enemy units to your side :D. But the real strategies are
1) Try to keep your week unit alive as many as possible.
2) Get out of the enemy’s reach, and make use of your allies.
3) Use zone of control to block enemies.
4) Make use of terrain.
 
BTW, this game is an open source software and has been ported to Windows (currently 1.5.3). It even supports my TFT’s 16:10 resolution – 1440×900 :D
